## The Journey:

The Journey so far has been challenging and fun at the same time for my team this was our `5th project`. the deadline was just a week, it all felt like we were working on a real product, and also we tried to enact the overall activity as the real working climate where we used git commands to collaborate throughout the project. The planning, discussions, and other team-relevant activities were done via zoom meetings. Each of us handled different tasks to ensure the successful submission of the project.

## Project Details:
